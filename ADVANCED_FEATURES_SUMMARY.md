## 🎯 3. ENHANCED PERSONA DETECTION

**Improved Algorithm:**
- More accurate detection based on multiple signals
- Updates in real-time as user answers
- Influences both question selection and coaching tips

**Detection Logic:**
```javascript
Confused User:
- Short answers (<20 words)
- High uncertainty markers (um, uh, maybe)
- Vague language
→ Agent response: Patient, encouraging, provides hints

Efficient User:
- Structured STAR answers
- Includes metrics/numbers
- Detailed (100-150 words)
→ Agent response: Increases difficulty, asks deeper questions

Chatty User:
- Long answers (200+ words)
- Off-topic keywords (weather, sports, movies)
- Rambling structure
→ Agent response: Polite redirect, suggests conciseness

Edge Case User:
- One-word answers
- Silence (30s timeout)
- Invalid inputs
→ Agent response: Graceful handling, no crashes
```
